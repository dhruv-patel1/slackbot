//DEIB SLACK BOT IDEA//

Requirements:
- bot deployed to all public/private channels
- do bot setup stuff in slack api
- need to host app somewhere (Flask/Fast API?)
- setup bot in workspace / setup event subscription
    - add endpoint where app is running to capture messages 
    - can setup to capture other events other than messages too

- when capturing a message
    - on the event get user, text, any mentions, or anything that we'd need 
    to identify the scenario in which to dm the user with some pre-typed warning message
    with links to resources
    - try to maybe figure out a way to store how many times a user has been warned


    -Identifying methods:
        - Look for pro-nouns in the message and look at mentioned users pronouns
            - if incorrect => dm warning
            - if correct => continue to next check
        - 

    
    
- if escalating condition met, have bot open a message with the user that sent
the message 
    - have it post the message we want with anything else
